Shell Scripting Skills

## Question
 This question is to test your aptitude for writing small shell scripts on Unix. You are given this URL https://www.amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt. Write a shell script that extracts the Scheme Name and Asset Value fields only and saves them in a tsv file. And ever wondered if this data should not be stored in JSON?


## Answer

This data should be stored in TSV rather than JSON because:

1. **Tabular Data**: TSV is particularly well-suited for tabular data where columns of values are separated by tabs or other delimiters. 

2. **Simplicity**: TSV is simpler and more lightweight compared to JSON.

3. **Parsing Efficiency**: Parsing TSV can be more efficient than parsing JSON, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## Instructions to use
* Run the command in terminal : `bash script.sh`

## Note
 This folder contains the shell script and the output of TSV file generated.
